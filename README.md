# Asteroids 3D

This project is a recreation of the classic arcade style game asteroids where the player controls a space ship and attemps to avoid asteroids and blow them up for points. In this revision there is a twist on the controls. The ship is controlled by the player holding a model up to a camera and the spaceship will copy is movement and rotation.
