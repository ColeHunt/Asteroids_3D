# Kinetic Impact

This project is a recreation of the classic arcade style game asteroids where the player controls a space ship and attemps to avoid asteroids and blow them up for points. In this revision there is a twist on the controls. The ship is controlled by the player holding a model up to a camera and the spaceship will copy is movement and rotation.

## Breakdown
A script using p5.js runs the game and creates the graphical interface that the user sees while playing the game. A processing script runs using the XBOX Kinect video feed as an input and collets the orientation and location of the triangle based of the it's position on the screen. This data moves the space ship accordingly.
